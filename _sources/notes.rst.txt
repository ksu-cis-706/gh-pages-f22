CIS Account
***********

If you do not have a CIS account, here is how to get one:

* Get a `K-State eID <https://eid.k-state.edu/>`__ if you don't already have one.

* `Sign up <https://selfserv.cs.ksu.edu/>`__ online for a CIS account
  (which requires an active eID first!).

* The account manager will approve your account and you will receive a password
  by email to by your eID account.  


GitHub Account
**************

Coursework submissions will be done via |GitHub|.
In the beginning of the course, each student will be given a private GitHub
repository; thus, you need to have a `GitHub account <https://github.com/join>`__.


.. _sireum:

Course Software Infrastructure
******************************

It is recommended that you use |SireumIVE| which provides all the required tools
for the course in a single bundle.
Once installed, you can found all the required tools under
``SIREUM_HOME/platform``.
(Alternatively, you can also choose to use `Sireum IVE next-gen <https://github.com/sireum/kekinian#sireum-a-high-assurance-system-engineering-platform>`__,
which under active development; the subsequent paragraphs assume the former.)

`Sireum IVE <http://logika.sireum.org/doc/01-getting-started/index.html#sireum-integrated-verification-environment-ive>`__
is installed in all CS labs (e.g., 1114 and 1117 Engineering Hall);
see :ref:`cslabs` for more information.

Below are some information if you prefer to install the required tools yourself.

You need |Java| 8 (or above) SDK to compile and test the course example code,
assignments, etc.
For your course work, you can choose to use |Scala| 2.12.12 (which still requires Java 8).

We will use the `Sbt <http://www.scala-sbt.org/>`__  build tool (1.3.13)
and |IntelliJ| with the following plugins (see the `IntelliJ doc <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html>`__
on how to install them):

* `ANTLR v4 grammar plugin <https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7358>`__

  |ANTLR| v4 is required for developing parser/lexer in the course.
  The ANTLR v4 grammar plugin is an excellent environment for ANTLR inside IntelliJ.
  It is highly recommended that you use the plugin when working with the course
  assignments.

* `JDT ASTView plugin <https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9345>`__

  To help you understand Eclipse Java Development Tools (JDT) object model
  Application Programming Interface (API), you can install the JDT ASTView plugin.
  The lectures assume that you have installed this plug-in.

* [ASM Bytecode Viewer](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10302-asm-bytecode-viewer)

  The example project uses ASM for generating Java class files.
  To help you understand ASM API, you can install the ASM Bytecode Viewer plugin.

* `Scala <https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1347>`__


StaticJava Compiler, Examples, and Slides
*****************************************

The course example projects (e.g., StaticJava Compiler) are stored in a Git
repository accessible at: https://github.com/ksu-cis-706/compiler

Slides can be accessed at: http://goo.gl/jODYcY

Note that the slides will be updated during the course so do not print them
until we have discussed the topics.

.. _cslabs:

K-State CS Laboratories
***********************


CS Windows Machines
===================

In a CS Windows machine (including Windows RDP server ``remote.win.cs.ksu.edu``),
Sireum IVE can be launched by using the start menu item ``Sireum`` (or ``Sireum32``
for the 32-bit version) or by issuing the command-line ``idea64`` or ``idea``.
Sireum CLI can be launched by issuing the command-line ``sireum``.

The absolute path to ``SIREUM_HOME`` is ``C:\Sireum``.


CS Linux Machines
=================

In a CS Linux machine (including using ``ssh -X`` or using
the faster remote desktop protocol `X2Go <wiki.x2go.org/>`__ to ``cslinux.cs.ksu.edu``),
Sireum IVE can be launched by issuing the command-line ``idea``.

The absolute path to ``SIREUM_HOME`` is ``/research/santos/sireum/linux64/Sireum``.


CS RDP macOS Server
===================

In the CS RDP macOS server ``remote-mac.cs.ksu.edu``,
Sireum IVE can be launched by double-clicking the ``Sireum`` icon in ``/Applications``
or by issuing the command-line: ``open /Applications/Sireum.app``.
Sireum CLI can be launched by issuing the command-line ``sireum``.

The absolute path to ``SIREUM_HOME`` is ``/Applications/Sireum.app/Contents/Resources/sireum-v3``.
